When there are conflicting principles, this manual and associated draw spreadsheet will take first precedent. Then the ISA rulebook will take precedent over the WSL rulebook.</p> <p>Each athlete is expected to read this manual to understand the purpose and mechanics of this type of training. This implies achieving an understanding of the draw format, the scheduling and the principles of how to train.</p> <p>It’s essential to be able to navigate this document so as to be able to find all relevant information, such as the ‘Athletes Code of Conduct’. This is also the case for the contest simulator spreadsheet, so to be able to locate the schedule, the draw, and the scores of each heat. Ensure immediate access to the link to the spreadsheet, and ensure the google sheets app is downloaded onto smartphone.</p> <p>The following is expected of each athlete.</p> <ul> <li>Undertake each next step with speed.</li> <li>Maintain alertness.</li> <li>Understand the sequence of heats and their expected times.</li> <li>Comprehend that taking on the identity of an athlete is to commit oneself to the ideal values of an athlete.</li> <li>Return the jersey to the beach marshal bucket immediately after each heat.

A more optimal method of training for a particular athletic goal is to perform regularly in a situation that equivalently emulates the situation under which the goal will be achieved. Rarely will it be argued that casual training ever feels like the high pressure situation of performing in a real contest. To confront face on that which is stressful is a good way to grow into it and become resilient and adaptable under the pressure of that situation. It’s an illusion to believe that training the purely technical skills of a sport will in itself provide the basis to succeed in any particular contest. It is perhaps equivalent to thinking that training to swim in a pool would perfectly prepare an athlete to swim in a stormy ocean.</p> <p>How common is it to find oneself surfing aimlessly and without an accurate sense to the quality of training and strategy within a short period of a heat? How difficult is it in an actual heat with tough opponents of a similar skill level? What type of thoughts and emotions actually rush through one’s mind? What mistakes are made? Consider how valuable it may be to confront these questions on a weekly basis and to begin to solve them earlier rather than later.</p> <p>The goal of the contest simulation is to create high density exposure to the reality of a contest environment so to create the basis for the necessary adaption. And to do so for all skill levels, ranging from initial club entry up to both ISA Games and WSL Series Events.</p> <p>This also creates the environment necessary for each individual athlete to benchmark their actual vs imagined progression, and to train the specific skills they lack.</p> <p>!! Note - even though this is a means of learning to find ease, solve problems and perform under contest pressure, it’s not a place to express one’s desire to perform so to gain status and feel elated about positive performances. If that is your intention then you are in the wrong place. The intention here is to develop a general attitude of level headedness, joyful effort and graciousness, both in light of wins or losses. Again, it’s significant amounts of experience that lends to this outcome.</p> <p>!! For athletes of less experience and skill, it’s suggested to generate the motivation to incrementally improve scores by half decimal places over a longer period of time. And to not predominantly focus on the competitive aspect of the training. Heats can be used as a means to train a technical skill under pressure. Similarly for the highest skilled athletes, the mere attendance in a contest environment over dense regular intervals can unconsciously create the desired adaption.</p> <p>!! And simultaneously to become familiar with the stress and consequence of competition, and to develop the skills to find a series of quality waves within a constraint of time and pressure.</p> <p>!! It’s also an opportunity to practise alignment with Olympic values, through content such as the ISA code of conduct. This is a more important skill in relation to long term success.</p> <h2 id="standard-principles"> <a href="#standard-principles" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="standard-principles"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Standard Principles </h2> <h3 id="simulation-event-protocols"> <a href="#simulation-event-protocols" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="simulation-event-protocols"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Simulation Event Protocols </h3> <p>“Check in at the beginning of the event “ Ask all necessary questions to ensure you have an adequate understanding of the plan.</p> <p>Once the event starts, you are expected to be alert and on immediate standby unless otherwise communicated The plan may change rapidly in adaption to the dynamics of a surf break</p> <p>As the session unfolds, you are expected to be within close enough proximity to be informed by such changes There are situations where you will be given time to rest and hang out without concern. But only when specifically stated and when not in contradiction to other information</p> <h3 id="heat-protocols"> <a href="#heat-protocols" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="heat-protocols"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Heat Protocols </h3> <p>Check in before each heat at beach marshal station Change rash vest for each heat. Provide color to marshal/judges</p> <p>Green board will indicate the beginning of a heat Yellow board will indicate that 5 minutes remain</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, heats will be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes of paddle out. There will be a small delay between heats</p> <p>Stay clear of the competitors lineup during paddle out. Prone to shore immediately at finish. Return to beach marshal ASAP and return the jersey If your heat is next, check-in and state your new jersey colour</p> <p>!! There may be consequences for breaking certain principles depending on how much disruption it causes. This will come in the form of penalties affecting point allocation. If you are carelessly slow in returning to shore or on returning to the beach marshal, you will likely be late for your next paddle out. The schedule will not change</p> <h3 id="proximity-to-judging-booth"> <a href="#proximity-to-judging-booth" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="proximity-to-judging-booth"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Proximity to Judging Booth </h3> <p>Results, scores and evolving draws can be read from the draw spreadsheet The scoring will be digitalized in which case you can use your phone to obtain the results and schedule</p> <p>!! Be particularly respectful when in close proximity to the judges It takes significant attention to maintain quality judging. The management of distractions is essential. Your care towards this principle will ensure your own scoring will be accurate.</p> <p>Before asking questions, first check if any competitors are up and riding and wait until the wave has been scored</p> <p>Avoid asking questions about time. Instead, keep track of the green board after your heat. There will usually be a minute or two between heats. If you have just surfed, note the time when the next heat starts, or start a new stopwatch. You don’t need to be precise with this time keeping. Remember the goal in this regard is usually to be by the waters edge for the beginning of your paddle out. If possible, a timer will be displayed by the color board which can be checked by those around the judging station.</p> <p>Athletes are welcome to assist in spotting and judging If you see someone paddling call out their color Watch to remember the details of what they do on the wave. The judges may ask for recalls of details missed or else forgotten. This is particularly important during back to back waves and spit peaks.</p> <p>Note the order of waves ridden in close succession.</p> <h2 id="judging-principles"> <a href="#judging-principles" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="judging-principles"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Judging Principles </h2> <h3 id="judging-criteria"> <a href="#judging-criteria" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="judging-criteria"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Judging Criteria </h3> <p>Major maneuvers are the backbone of increasing your scores.

Therefore, if the lower skilled athlete performs excellently they will just beat the average performance of the higher skilled surfer</p> <p>This is not reason to become frustrated or undermine the status of higher scores of a less skilled athlete Remember that the highest skilled athletes in these events are already receiving inflated scores relative to WSL scales</p> <p>It’s in your interest, as a higher skilled athlete, to lose during these events when performing at your normal level of performance It’s in your interest, as a lower skilled athlete, to win during these events when performing significantly above average</p> <p>There will be errors made in implementing this until it’s worked out more precisely</p> <h3 id="protest"> <a href="#protest" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="protest"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Protest </h3> <p>You’re encouraged to protest your scores when you reason an error is significant In some cases, a major error can be reversed if the reversal is practical. But in general the result is final.</p> <p>Protesting achieves the following A. Improves judging and event management B. Improves dialogue with judges over errors made, and thus improves capacities in protesting results at real events C. Improves your understanding of the judging criteria and priority</p> <p>The organizers and judges will make mistakes. And they will also respond to protests with mistakes. Be understanding and patient with this If you feel like a judgement or protest was unfairly dealt with, try again. Consider this as part of the contest simulation, and so, learn how to do so in a way where your surfing will not suffer from the possible psychological consequences of recieving an unwanted decision. Develop resilience.</p> <p>If an athlete protests, then the schedule may be suspended to resolve the judgement before proceeding with subsequent heats</p> <h2 id="simulation-formats"> <a href="#simulation-formats" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="simulation-formats"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Simulation Formats </h2> <h3 id="draws"> <a href="#draws" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="draws"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Draws </h3> <p>Examples of shorthand notations that may be found in the simulator app.</p> <div class="table-wrapper"><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Notation</th> <th>Description</th> <th> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>RND1 1</td> <td>ROUND 1 HEAT 1</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>RND2</td> <td>SHORTHAND FOR ALL HEATS OF ROUND 2</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>BON1 1</td> <td>BONUS 1 HEAT 1</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>FIN1 1</td> <td>FINAL OF DIVISION 1, HEAT 1</td> <td>Typically just 1 heat although sometimes a multi heat final with eg best of 3 can be run</td> </tr> <tr> <td>FIN1</td> <td>SHORTHAND FOR FIN1 1</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Double elim with bonus and multi divisions: Repacharge system with multiple finals to establish all specific placings after those in the main round final.
