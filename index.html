      <h1 id="principles-of-simulation">PRINCIPLES OF SIMULATION</h1>

<p>(DRAFT V4)</p>

<h2 id="necessary-preparation">Necessary Preparation</h2>

<h3 id="briefing">Briefing</h3>

<p>The running principles aim to emulate as specifically as possible the rulebooks of both the International Surf Association and the World Surf League.</p>

<p>Principles from those rulebooks are assumed, unless otherwise stated within this manual. When there are conflicting principles, this manual and associated draw spreadsheet will take first precedent. Then the ISA rulebook will take precedent over the WSL rulebook.</p>

<p>Each athlete is expected to read this manual to understand the purpose and mechanics of this type of training. This implies achieving an understanding of the draw format, the scheduling and the principles of how to train.</p>

<p>It’s essential to be able to navigate this document so as to be able to find all relevant information, such as the ‘Athletes Code of Conduct’. This is also the case for the contest simulator spreadsheet, so to be able to locate the schedule, the draw, and the scores of each heat. Ensure immediate access to the link to the spreadsheet, and ensure the google sheets app is downloaded onto smartphone.</p>

<p>The following is expected of each athlete.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Undertake each next step with speed.</li>
  <li>Maintain alertness.</li>
  <li>Understand when their next heat will be.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind they are taking the role of an athlete and are therefore committing themselves in the direction of the ideal values of an athlete.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each athlete must return their jersey to the beach marshal bucket immediately after each heat. They must collect their next jersey as quickly as is possible. They must choose a different colour to the previous heat.</p>

<h3 id="athlete-preparation">Athlete Preparation</h3>

<p>Prepare a kit bag with all necessary equipment for training.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watch</li>
  <li>Learner’s notebook; Wave observation notebook/cards/board</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Backups of board, wax, fins, fin key, leash</li>
  <li>Waterproof and warm clothes for staying warm during gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>Immediate access to the simulator spreadsheet with an understanding of its layout and how to navigate it.</p>

<p>Full understanding of everything set out in the spreadsheet and manual.</p>

<p>Consider arriving before check-in so to be fully prepared and to do a thorough and individualized warm-up surf.
Setup base with ease of access to equipment</p>

<h3 id="purpose-of-simulation">Purpose of Simulation</h3>

<p>The goal of contest simulation is to create high density exposure to the reality of a contest environment. And to do so for all skill levels, ranging from initial club entry all the way up to ISA Games and WSL Series.</p>

<p>This creates the environment necessary for each individual athlete to benchmark their actual vs imagined progression, and to train the specific skills they lack.</p>

<p>!! This is objective testing and skill training, and not a means to perform for showcasing and gaining status, or to beat specific athletes. If that is your intention then you are in the wrong place</p>

<p>!! For athletes of less skill and experience, it’s suggested to generate the motivation to incrementally improve scores by half decimal places over a long period of time. 
!! And simultaneously to become familiar with the stress and consequence of a contest, and to concurrently develop the skills to find a series of quality waves within a time constraint of 20 minutes.</p>

<p>!! It’s also an opportunity to practise alignment with Olympic values, through content such as the ISA code of conduct. This is a more important skill in relation to long term success.</p>

<h2 id="standard-principles">Standard Principles</h2>

<h3 id="simulation-event-protocols">Simulation Event Protocols</h3>

<p>“Check in at the beginning of the event
“
Ask all necessary questions to ensure you have an adequate understanding of the plan.</p>

<p>Once the event starts, you are expected to be alert and on immediate standby unless otherwise communicated
The plan may change rapidly in adaption to the dynamics of a surf break</p>

<p>As the session unfolds, you are expected to be within close enough proximity to be informed by such changes
There are situations where you will be given time to rest and hang out without concern. But only when specifically stated and when not in contradiction to other information</p>

<h3 id="heat-protocols">Heat Protocols</h3>

<p>Check in before each heat at beach marshal station
Change rash vest for each heat. Provide color to marshal/judges</p>

<p>Green board will indicate the beginning of a heat
Yellow board will indicate that 5 minutes remain</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, heats will be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes of paddle out. There will be a small delay between heats</p>

<p>Stay clear of the competitors lineup during paddle out.
Prone to shore immediately at finish.
Return to beach marshal ASAP and return the jersey
If your heat is next, check-in and state your new jersey colour</p>

<p>!! There may be consequences for breaking certain principles depending on how much disruption it causes. This will come in the form of penalties affecting point allocation.
If you are carelessly slow in returning to shore or on returning to the beach marshal, you will likely be late for your next paddle out. The schedule will not change</p>

<h3 id="proximity-to-judging-booth">Proximity to Judging Booth</h3>

<p>Results, scores and evolving draws can be read from the draw spreadsheet
The scoring will be digitalized in which case you can use your phone to obtain the results and schedule</p>

<p>!! Be particularly respectful when in close proximity to the judges
It takes significant attention to maintain quality judging. The management of distractions is essential. Your care towards this principle will ensure your own scoring will be accurate.</p>

<p>Before asking questions, first check if any competitors are up and riding and wait until the wave has been scored</p>

<p>Avoid asking questions about time. Instead, keep track of the green board after your heat.
There will usually be a minute or two between heats. If you have just surfed, note the time when the next heat starts, or start a new stopwatch.
You don’t need to be precise with this time keeping. Remember the goal in this regard is usually to be by the waters edge for the beginning of your paddle out.
If possible, a timer will be displayed by the color board which can be checked by those around the judging station.</p>

<p>Athletes are welcome to assist in spotting and judging
If you see someone paddling call out their color
Watch to remember the details of what they do on the wave. The judges may ask for recalls of details missed or else forgotten. This is particularly important during back to back waves and spit peaks.</p>

<p>Note the order of waves ridden in close succession.</p>

<h2 id="judging-principles">Judging Principles</h2>

<h3 id="judging-criteria">Judging Criteria</h3>

<p>Major maneuvers are the backbone of increasing your scores. One single maneuver brings a score into the excellent range.</p>

<h3 id="scoring-parity">Scoring Parity</h3>

<p>Scoring parity is an evolving concept and will be refined objectively as time evolves.</p>

<p>Depending on the event, a scoring parity will be applied in a degree which correlates to the division and the surfers
In the second division, the higher seeded athletes will be disadvantaged through higher parities so to be at an overall disadvantage</p>

<p>In division one, it will be scaled to make it feel as though higher skilled athletes are competing against athletes of equivalent skill
The higher skilled athletes will still hold the advantage but only by a small margin
The best possible surfing of the least skilled surfer, relative to their most common performance norm, would scale to about 6 to 7 points
This itself would be relative to a scale where the higher skilled surfer can normally score about 5 to 6 points.
Therefore, if the lower skilled athlete performs excellently they will just beat the average performance of the higher skilled surfer</p>

<p>This is not reason to become frustrated or undermine the status of higher scores of a less skilled athlete
Remember that the highest skilled athletes in these events are already receiving inflated scores relative to WSL scales</p>

<p>It’s in your interest, as a higher skilled athlete, to lose during these events when performing at your normal level of performance
It’s in your interest, as a lower skilled athlete, to win during these events when performing significantly above average</p>

<p>There will be errors made in implementing this until it’s worked out more precisely</p>

<h3 id="protest">Protest</h3>

<p>You’re encouraged to protest your scores when you reason an error is significant
In some cases, a major error can be reversed if the reversal is practical. But in general the result is final.</p>

<p>Protesting achieves the following
A. Improves judging and event management
B. Improves dialogue with judges over errors made, and thus improves capacities in protesting results at real events
C. Improves your understanding of the judging criteria and priority</p>

<p>The organizers and judges will make mistakes. And they will also respond to protests with mistakes.
Be understanding and patient with this
If you feel like a judgement or protest was unfairly dealt with, try again.
Consider this as part of the contest simulation, and so, learn how to do so in a way where your surfing will not suffer from the possible psychological consequences of recieving an unwanted decision. Develop resilience.</p>

<p>If an athlete protests, then the schedule may be suspended to resolve the judgement before proceeding with subsequent heats</p>

<p>Double elim with bonus and multi divisions:
Repacharge system with multiple finals to establish all specific placings after those in the main round final. And with Bonus heats to both generate motivation to earn more points and catch up with main round finalists, and to equalize heat count opportunities.
The higher level seeds can choose to bypass bonus heats so to both simulate wait times found in real contests and to prepare for their main round final. They will however be forfeiting their opportunity to extend their overall point lead.</p>

<p>Best of three heats progresses from round 1.</p>

<p>If draw for 2nd place, it will be decided on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The result of the heat between the surfers who drew
Bottom three will go to division 2 final. 
Tournament 2 will be a second cycle with bonus points awarded</li>

<p>Bonus heats may carry an allocation of extra points to the athletes in their respective categories if they manage to out compete athletes of a higher seeding.
If an eliminated surfer places higher than the highest performing surfer, they may earn an extra 2000 points.
If they perform better than the highest placing athlete in the division 2 final, they may receive enough points to equalize their overall placing on the points leader board with that athlete</p>

<p>Depending on the number of competitors per tournament cycle in the event, FINAL2 placing will determine overall placings below those who have progressed to the main FINAL1</p>

<p>Bonus Heats will reward extra points to an athletes overall stack of event points.</p>

<p>A competitor who places 2nd in FINAL2 but who places higher than 1st of FINAL2 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with that competitor in that cycle</p>

<p>A competitor who places 1st in FINAL2 but who places higher than an athlete from FINAL1 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with last place of FINAL1</p>

<p>The general rule is that a skillful result within a BONUS heat presents the opportunity to equalize with an athlete who finishes 1 place ahead in the tournament cycle. 4th place would recieve equal points to 3rd; 5th to 4th and so on.</p>
