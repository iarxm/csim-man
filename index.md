(DRAFT V7 - EARLY MANUSCRIPT; 50% COMPLETION)

Construct Motto - "Gravity is but a notion for consideration"

Herein are principles for creating degrees of realness in training, 
    in advance of both The Games and The Real.
We will define this as constructing.

The goal is to facilitate experiences which accelerate technical and strategic surf development.
Such experiences may come in the form of an inspiration towards questioning,
of what was previously thought of as necessary limitations.
Or as Plato may argue, the realisation of falsehood-ignorance

> "This would be most correctly called true falsehood-ignorance in the soul of someone who has been told a falsehood. Falsehood in words is a kind of imitation of this affection in the soul, an image of it that comes into being after it and is not a pure falsehood."
        Plato, The Republic

## Preparation

### Briefing

These principles of training are written for all levels of skill.
The density of detail will address all possible needs, 
therefore each athlete can address elements which are a priority to them.

The construct scoring app to be used currently exists as a public spreadsheet 
    and will be shared ahead of each games construct.
It will provide both live scoring and draw updates.

The following suggestions will aid as first steps towards success.
Consistent attention toward them will lead to results within the construct, and as such, in long term rewards at The Surf Games.


### Comprehension

The following will provide an ability for situational awareness during training:

- Understand how to navigate The Construct scoring app to be able to locate information about heats, scores and schedules.
- Understand how to navigate the book of construct principles to quickly find reference to elements used in training briefings such at the The Games Values section.
- Thorough understanding of the draw, sequence and timing of heats.
- Comprehend principles of The Surf Construct.
- Comprehend what it means to be an athlete with an understanding that taking on the identity of such is to imply oneself towards the ideal values of an athlete.


### Performance

Making the following attitudinal commitments will aid towards the psychological demands of training:

- Undertake each next step with speed and conscientiousness.
- On speed, emphasis being placed on returning to the beach marshal post heat and preparing for the subsequent heat.
- Maintain alertness and be on immediate standby to a rapidly evolving plan.


### Recall

The following will act as keystone habits for broader sets of important skills and outcomes:

- Returning jersey's immediately after each heat.  Promptly collecting jersey's for the next heat.
- Staying focused after the heat finishes and moving rapidly to the next task.
- Choosing a different jersey colour to the previous heat. Avoiding the temptation to ask whether it's acceptable to wear the same jersey. Develop the habit to change colors without hesitation.
- Keep close awareness on time by habitually checking watch.


### Equipment

Consider preparing and maintaining a kit bag with all important equipment for successful training. Consider the following:

- Watch
- Learner's notebook; Wave observation notebook/cards/board
- Water
- Backups of: Wax, fins, fin key, leash
- Waterproof and warm clothes for staying warm during gaps
- 2x or 3x boards


Equipment Maintenance

- Are all boards sufficiently repaired and if necessary - re-waxed?
- Maintaining board with quality waxing. This type of habit will be a benchmark for attention to other important details.
    - Lack of care to such a detail will be an indicator that failure is looming.
- Maintaining a watch and backup option.
    - Consider that smart watches are easily left without charging or forgotten because they were taken off to charge.
    - It's more reliable to have a standard quality waterproof watch in one's kit.
        - Casio 100m resistance is minimum sufficiency for surf training.


### Tactical and Logistical

- Establishing immediate access to the Construct scoring app throughout training and having google sheets downloaded to phone.
- Consider arriving before check-in so to be fully prepared and to provide ample opportunity for a thorough and individualized beach and surf warm-up.
- Setup a station for personal equipment in close proximity to the site for ease of access throughout training.


### Most Common Points Of Failure

- Time management errors due to no means of precision in time keeping.
    - Poor quality or broken watches
    - Insufficient preparation
- Arriving late causing a state of rush
- Poor understanding of heat draw leading to misapprehension of what needs to be done.


## Motivation and Organisation

### Purpose of Surf Construct

#### Problem Statement

Training with a vague intention alone to improve performance in real heats works out to be insufficient training. Rarely will a strong argument be made that casual training feels like the high pressure situation of performing in a real game.

It's also an illusion to believe that training the purely technical skills of a discipline will in itself provide the basis to succeed in The Games. It is perhaps equivalent to thinking that training to swim in a pool would perfectly prepare an athlete to swim in a stormy ocean. Or learning how to technically perform martial art skills without sparring will prepare one for performing in the ring.

Moreover, recall how common it is to find oneself surfing aimlessly and without an accurate sense to the quality of training and strategy. Compare this to having to perform a specific goal within a short period of a 20 minute heat. Recall how difficult is it in a real heat with opponents of a similar skill level. Remember the type of thoughts and emotions which actually appear in one's mind. Consider how many and what type of mistakes are made, and how valuable it would be to confront these questions on a weekly basis to begin to skillfully solve those mistakes earlier rather than later.

A more optimal method, which is true for athletic goals in general, is to perform regularly in a situation that equivalently emulates the situation under which the goal will be achieved. This is to confront face on that which is stressful. This is a means to grow into that pressure and become resilient through familiarity. Learn to be psychologically and strategically flexible and become adaptable under the pressure of that situation.


#### Goals of Surf Construct

The goal of constructing is to create high density exposure to the reality of a Games environment so to create the basis for the necessary adaption. And to do so for all skill levels, ranging from initial club entry up to both ISA Games and WSL Series Events.

This also creates the environment necessary for each individual athlete to benchmark their actual vs imagined progression, and to train the specific skills they lack.

!! Note - even though this is a means of learning to find ease, solve problems and perform under Real Games pressure, it's not a place to express one's desire to perform so to gain status and feel elated about positive performances. If that is your intention then you are in the wrong place. The intention here is to develop a general attitude of level headedness, joyful effort and graciousness, both in light of wins or losses. Again, it's significant amounts of experience that lends to this outcome.

!! For athletes of less experience and skill, it's suggested to generate the motivation to incrementally improve scores by half decimal places over a longer period of time. And to not predominantly focus on the hierarchical results aspect of the training. Heats can be used as a means to train a technical skill under pressure. Similarly for the highest skilled athletes, the mere attendance in a Games environment over dense regular intervals can unconsciously create the desired adaption.

!! And simultaneously to become familiar with the stress and consequence of Games, and to develop the skills to find a series of quality waves within a constraint of time and pressure.

!! It's also an opportunity to practise alignment with Olympic values, through content such as the ISA code of conduct. This is a more important skill in relation to long term success.


### Rulebook Precedence

The running principles aim to emulate as specifically as possible the rulebooks of both the International Surf Association and the World Surf League.

Principles from those rulebooks are assumed, unless otherwise stated within this manual. When there are conflicting principles, this manual and associated draw spreadsheet will take first precedent. Then the ISA rulebook will take precedent over the WSL rulebook.

Each athlete is expected to read this manual to understand the purpose and mechanics of this type of training. This implies achieving an understanding of the draw format, the scheduling and the principles of how to train.




## Standard Principles

### Session Protocols

1. Check-in at the beginning of the event
    1. Ask all necessary questions during the check-in meeting. Ensure a sufficient understanding of the session plan. Keep asking questions if this is unclear.
1. Once the event starts be alert throughout and on immediate standby unless otherwise communicated
1. The plan may change rapidly in adaption to the dynamics of a surf break
1. As the session unfolds, be within close enough proximity to be informed by rapid changes.
1. There are situations where time will be given to rest and be without concern, but only when specifically stated and ensure such information is clear and not in contradiction to other plans.


### Heat Protocols


1. Check in before each heat at beach marshal station.
1. Choose a different jersey color for each heat.
1. Provide color to marshal/judges
1. Green board will indicate the beginning of a heat
1. Yellow board will indicate 5 minutes are remaining
1. Unless otherwise stated, heats will be 20 minutes long by default.
1. Similarly, there will be 5 minutes of paddle out by default.
1. There will be a small delay between heats
1. Stay clear of the podium lineup during paddle out.
1. Prone to shore immediately on heat finish.
1. Promptly return the jersey to the beach marshal 
1. If surfing in the next heat, check-in and state new jersey colour

### Proximity to Judging Booth

1. Results, scores and evolving draws can be read from the draw spreadsheet.
1. The scoring will be digitalized in which case you can use your phone to obtain the results and schedule
1. This allows the judges to maintain focus on the heat at hand.


Be particularly respectful when in close proximity to the judges

1. It takes significant attention to maintain quality judging. The management of distractions is essential. Your care towards this principle will ensure your own scoring will be accurate.
1. Before asking questions, first check if any athletes are up and riding and wait until the wave has been scored
1. Avoid asking questions about time. Instead, keep track of the green board after your heat.
1. There will usually be a minute or two between heats. If you have just surfed, note the time when the next heat starts, or start a new stopwatch.
1. Time keeping between heats does not need to be to the second of precision. Remember the goal between heats is usually to be on time by the waters edge for the beginning of the next paddle out.
1. If possible, the time will be recorded in the app, and or a timer will be displayed by the color board which can be checked by those around the judging station.


#### Judging Assistance

1. Athletes are encouraged to assist in spotting and judging
1. If an athlete is seen paddling for a wave then call that to attention with reference to their colour.
1. Watch to remember the details of each wave surfed. The judges may ask for recalls of details missed or else forgotten. This is particularly important during back to back waves and spit peaks.
1. Note the order sequence of waves ridden in close succession and whether an athlete went right or left as this all helps with accurately recalling the waves to be scored.
1. Optionally an athlete can help input the scores of a judge if the judge calls them out.
1. Optionally an athlete can act as judge for one or more heats if they have sufficient time.

### Penalties

There may be consequences for breaking certain principles depending on how much disruption it causes.

1. This may come in the form of penalties affecting point allocation or affecting the scores of counting waves during a related heat.
1. Being careless and slow in returning to shore or on returning to the beach marshal will likely result in being late for the next paddle out. This will have an effect on performance.



## Scoring Principles

### Judging Criteria

#### The Major Maneuver

1. A single major maneuver constitutes the bulk of a single score. The increasing quality of single maneuver's can bring scores into the excellent range.
1. Transitional surfing and skillful combinations are relevant to increasing the density and control of major maneuvers on a wave.
1. The quality of the major maneuver to which the transitional surfing occurs will be the limiting factor to the score.

#### Common Judging or Audience Problems

1. A common and repeated misunderstanding is to either judge for or expect judges to give high scores for the factors of flow and aesthetic alone. These factors only apply once a major maneuver has been established.
1. Another common issue is for scoring to pool in the range of 2 to 6 without clear distinction made to surfing which is factually better or worse.
    1. Often this is the cause of poor judging quality.
    1. From the perspective of an athlete, as long as two good waves are caught this problem will be circumvented.
    1. A more worthy intent is to win by a margin and avoid making a fuss about situations where the loss was marginal to the point of being subjectively variant.


#### Framing the Goal Posts

The focus of the athlete is to find the best opportunity to complete the most critical maneuver possible relative to their skill. And to do so on two separate waves within the time constraint of the heat.

The mind therefore can be set to search for the steepest and most energy dense section, and to skillfully place oneself within a high and tight trajectory across that section.

To describe this a second way, it's being in the right place at the right time with the right speed and the right posture and orientation of both body and board.


#### Analyzing the Path

Once that is the near term object of attention, the athlete can work in reverse order to get to that point. The 12 Skills of an excellent score can be used for problem solving this during planning and execution.

1. Thorough on beach preparation: Skillful observation; Physical warm-up; Surf movement simulation
2. Lineup positioning in relation to landmarks
3. Lineup positioning in relation to opponents
4. Wave selection
5. Peak Positioning
6. Wave Entry
7. Halo turn - first major maneuver

The skills have only been listed up until 7 to illustrate that the fist half off the skills, which all precede standing on the board, represents the bulk of the path through the first 8 points of the 10 point wave judging scale.

These are the skills which go into being at the right place at the right time on the wave of consequence.

A poor performance or a bad surf can often be reduced within a session to one of these skills.


#### Types of Directed Attention

Consider these ideas with utmost attention.

Note that an analytic and obsessive form of thinking about such ideas during a heat performances will likely cause significant hindrance by creating hesitation and cognitive tunnel vision.

It can however, be beneficial to lightly focus the mind in the direction of each point. Enough so to trigger the already developed best standard of each skill domain.

The skills are laid out in a sequence, and they can be considered as a type of sprint between markers. Attention can be placed precisely enough on the next immediate one to sufficiently achieve it.


### Scoring Parity

Scoring parity is an evolving concept and will be refined objectively as time evolves.

Depending on the event, a scoring parity will be applied in a degree which correlates to the division and the surfers
In the second division, the higher seeded athletes will be disadvantaged through higher parities so to be at an overall disadvantage


In division one, it will be scaled to make it feel as though higher skilled athletes are constructing against athletes of equivalent skill
The higher skilled athletes will still hold the advantage but only by a small margin
The best possible surfing of the least skilled surfer, relative to their most common performance norm, would scale to about 6 to 7 points
This itself would be relative to a scale where the higher skilled surfer can normally score about 5 to 6 points.
Therefore, if the lower skilled athlete performs excellently they will just beat the average performance of the higher skilled surfer

This is not reason to become frustrated or undermine the status of higher scores of a less skilled athlete
Remember that the highest skilled athletes in these events are already receiving inflated scores relative to WSL scales

- It's in your interest, as a higher skilled athlete, to lose during these events when performing at your normal level of performance
- It's in your interest, as a lower skilled athlete, to win during these events when performing significantly above average

There will be errors made in implementing this until it's worked out more precisely


### Protest

Protesting is encouraged where there is a perceived error of consequence. In some cases, a major error can be reversed if the reversal is practical but in general the result is final.

In the case of a protest, the schedule may be suspended to resolve the topic before proceeding with subsequent heats. If a complicated and attention demanding protest is raised during an active heat within a constructing of 1 judge, then the protest will be postponed until the active heat is finished and attention can be redirected towards addressing it.

Considering this is the general process it's therefore important to raise the protest as quickly as possible so if necessary the judge can alert the athletes who may be about to paddle out in the next heat.

Resolution can take the form of re-surfs, surf off's, and direct amendment of the result.

Protesting achieves the following

- A. Improves judging and event management by facilitating the realisation of errors.
- B. Improves ability to have difficult conversations with judges and administrators over errors made. Improves capacities in protesting results at real events.
- C. Improves understanding of the judging criteria and also The Games rules, through critical debate.


Mistakes are expected in judging and organisation. Any system administered by humans will be prone to human error. A more reliable way to establish trust in a organisation is to be honest about that nature and to encourage open dialogue towards rapid improvement. Note that this process of creating critical thinking and open dialogue is even more prone to error than the subject in question. Mistakes will be made in protest and in response to protest.

Develop understanding and patience. If it feels like a judgement or protest was unfairly dealt with, continue to raise the top constructively with persistence.

Consider this as part of The Construct. As part of the desired learning outcomes learn to protest as constructively and critically as possible. Stay calm and persist under pressure. Learn to facilitate a critical conversation when the point of contact is not reciprocating a willingness towards critical conversation. Learn to be gracious when proven wrong or right and move forward to the next task without hesitation. Achieve all of this without any negative psychological consequences. Develop resilience.


## Construct Formats

Each construct will generally be tied into a ranking established across a construct series. This will be implemented via a point system with the WSL system taking first precedence in the modelling.

A goal of a construct draw within an event is to maximize the heats surfed with all the core goals of constructing in mind. This implies cycles of tournaments within the training session, with divisional finals and bonus heats.

The draw will be split into tournament cycles of different or equivalent formats depending on time available and athletes entered. 'Tournament 2' will be a second cycle with additional points awarded, and so on.

The logic is to establish a route of consequence which maintains a sense of reality to that of The Games. This provides continuous motivation and focus. Every heat surfed moves an athlete up or down the event ranking.

This provides the motivation to rapidly review and learn from each heat. One poor performance will only move an athlete down slightly, and the next heat will either provide the opportunity to completely recover from that loss or to finish as high as possible relative to their evolving event seed.

The overall points allocated per the event will be normalized to 10,000 or less as described below.


### Draw Formats

- Straight Elimination
- Straight Elimination with divisions and bonus.
- Bonus Double ELIM with DIVS
- Best of Three
- Best of Three with Finals
- Best of X heats
- ELO Tournaments


#### Bonus Double Elim w. Divs

1. Repechage system with multiple finals to establish all specific placings after those in the main round final. And with Bonus heats to both generate motivation to earn more points and catch up with main round finalists, and to equalize heat count opportunities.
1. The higher level seeds can choose to bypass bonus heats so to both simulate wait times found in real games and to prepare for their main round final. They will however be forfeiting their opportunity to extend their overall point lead.


#### Best of Three

- Best of three heats progresses to the next round.
- Bottom three will be eliminated into the lower division
- If two athletes draw for a place in the final, it will be decided on the following in order of priority:
    1. The result of the heat between the surfers who drew.
    1. The highest average heat score across all three heats.
    1. A single wave surf off.


### Heat Types - Conventional

#### Traditional Heat

- Heat with 2 to 4 person's.
- Max 15 waves with 2 best counting.
- Each wave scored on a scale between 0 to 10.
- Typically 20 minutes long with 5 minute paddle out.


#### Modifications for Crowd Control

- Only Inside waves count
- 4 set waves over 30 minutes
- Organisational Strategies
    - Arrive first and take priority of the lineup before free surfers arrive.
    - Keep athletes with coloured rash vests in the water at all times.
    - Make regular horn and whistle noises.
    - Utilize large color board and make judging site visible to judges.
    - Establish presence which discourages free surfer's from joining lineup.


#### Limited Wave Count

- Single, double, triple or quadruple wave allowance per heat
- Best single wave score


#### ELO Match OFFS

Two surfer's decide their own format. The winner increases their ELO score and vice versa.


### Heat Types - Progressive

#### Game of SURF

1. Rock paper scissors.
1. Winner goes first and completes a trick.
1. Second surfer attempts to emulate the maneuver.
1. If they fail they receive a letter in SURF.
1. The first surfer to receive all letters loses the round.


#### Claim Your Score with or without Tag Team

Claim the wave you decide to be scored on. Race in and tag your team mate. Repeat.


#### Athlete Construct Bots

Future implementation - athlete engine's from WSL profiles which predict the performance and scores of such an athlete in relation to available set waves and their probabilities of turning a small wave into a large score. Bot constructing as if the athlete is surfing the heat remotely.


### Heat Title Notation

Examples of shorthand notations that may be found in the constructing score app.

| Notation | Expanded Titles                    | Notes                                                                                    |
|----------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RND1 1   | ROUND 1 HEAT 1                     |                                                                                          |
| RND2     | SHORTHAND FOR ALL HEATS OF ROUND 2 |                                                                                          |
| BON1 1   | BONUS 1 HEAT 1                     |                                                                                          |
| FIN1 1   | FINAL OF DIVISION 1, HEAT 1        | Typically just 1 heat although sometimes a multi heat final with eg best of 3 can be run |
| FIN1     | SHORTHAND FOR FIN1 1               |                                                                                          |




### Points Allocation Principles


#### Point Stacking Per Event

The total points within each event will be tallied and the leaders total points will then normalize all allocated points to be equal to or less than 10,000. The leader will receive 10,000 points.

All other athletes will receive points based on the following

$Event_Points = $Total_Of_Athlete * ( 10,000 / ( $Total_Of_Leader ) )


#### Points Per Tournament Cycles

| PLACE | POINTS |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 10,000 |
| 2     | 7,800  |
| 3     | 6,085  |
| 4     | 4,745  |
| 5     | 3,320  |
| 6     | 3,000  |
| 7     | 2,600  |
| 8     | 2,200  |
| 9     | 1,800  |
| 10    | 1,330  |

Depending on the number of constructors per tournament cycle, and the format of the cycle, FINAL-2 placing will determine overall placings below those who have progressed to the main round FINAL-1


#### Points Per Bonus Heats

Bonus Heats will reward extra points to an athlete's overall event stack. This will be relative to an athlete's performance relative to their respective categories such as cases where they relatively out perform athletes of a higher seeding.

1. If an eliminated surfer places higher than the highest performing surfer, they may earn the equivalent of an additional 2000 points.
1. If they perform better than the highest placing athlete in the division 2 final, they may receive additional points to equalize their overall placing with that athlete in that cycle on the points leader board.
1. A constructor who places 2nd in FINAL2 but who places higher than 1st of FINAL2 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with that constructor in that cycle
1. A constructor who places 1st in FINAL2 but who places higher than an athlete from FINAL1 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with last place of FINAL1
1. The general rule is that a skillful result within a BONUS heat presents the opportunity to equalize with an athlete who finishes 1 place ahead in the tournament cycle.
1. Fourth place would receive equal points to 3rd; 5th to 4th and so on.




## Olympic Principles

### Classical Aristotelian Virtues

1. Courage
2. Temperance
3. Prudence
4. Justice


### The Games Code

This section is adapted from the International Surfing Association website. It has been slightly reworded to favour these ideas as suggestions as opposed to rules.

"The ISA Code of Conduct outlines the standard of behavior expected of all members of Federations that are members of the International Surfing Association (ISA), as well as all Officials employed or volunteering with the ISA.  It is a formal statement of the values and ethical standards that guide individuals in sport. It is a set of principles and norms to which sportspeople and officials can be held accountable when representing their country or officiating at any ISA event.  The Code is used as a point of reference when dealing with disciplinary procedures against members or officials."

An athlete who participates at the ISA Surf Games is committed to the following:

#### Respect

- Respect the rules and play in the spirit of the game.
- Respect opponents.
- Respect other athletes and officials’ cultures and beliefs.
- Respect the officials and their decisions.
- Respect the facilities and equipment.

#### Construct with Integrity

- Be gracious in victory and defeat.
- Construct fairly.

#### Act with Integrity

- Display high standards of behavior that promote a positive image for surfing.
- Refrain from the use of profane, insulting, harassing or otherwise offensive language or behaviour on or off the field of play.
- Strive to maintain a sense of self-control and dignity at all times.
- Maintain a sense of integrity.

#### Team Orientated

- Do one's best to be a true team player.
- Give teammates positive input and feedback.
- Help others to resist corrupting pressures.
- Denounce those who attempt to discredit the sport.
- Honor those who defend the sport’s good reputation.
- Reject corruption, drug abuse, racism & violence.
- Thank officials and opposing teams.

#### Drug Free Sport

- Never advocate or condone the abuse of drugs or other banned substances or methods.
- Abstain from the use of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages when representing my country or at an ISA event.
- Never provide under age participants with alcohol.
- Participate in all team testing and satisfy all team program-testing objectives.

#### Ambassadorship

- Not block the ISA logo during video or still camera photography activity.
- Provide interviews to official and on-site event media as requested regardless of heat result.

#### Safety

- Communicate and co-operate with registered medical practitioners/testing centers in the diagnoses, treatment and management of medical problems and respect the concerns these medical people have when they are considering my future health and well being and when they are making decisions regarding my ability to continue to play or train.


### Training Principles

#### Focus and Attention

Speed and focus is essential to ensuring success throughout the event. It allows for contingencies when problems arise. For example if it's realised that a backup board would be more suitable for the subsequent heat but time was needlessly lost during return to the games site, it may either make the contingency infeasible or bring about a sense of rush which is not optimal for the performance in the next heat.

Consider what you need to prepare for your next heat before engaging in anything unrelated to the performance of that heat.


#### Temperature Control

It's common in Games to experience non optimal gaps of time between heats, therefore think through such situations and experiment with how to pragmatically navigate these possibilities. In general, if the gap is just long enough, it can be of better value to be fully unsuited and dry. Temperature and circulation are core factors relating to athletic performance, and being damp whilst waiting idle can cause the body to start to shut down. In the case of exhaustion and physical shutdown, it's significantly more effective to override this state from a short period of being dry and unsuited. Even a wetsuit which has dried whilst being worn still causes stress, and interfere with circulation.

These considerations assume it's feasible to fully dry and that sufficient thermal clothing is at hand. Consider options in the case of heavy rain and no access to either shelter or water proof clothing. It may also be of significant benefit to bring warm water and warm food to augment temperature regulation. However, note that eating too much can be equally problematic.


#### Emotional Control

Be cautious with coffee and tea. They can be of benefit in other contexts, but with regards to surfing there is a very high risk they will interference with control of emotion, temperature and circulation.

In the context of Games pressure it's most desirable to be adaptable through the ability to increase of decrease one's degree of focus and energy through the mind alone. Second to this, control can be sought through exercise and breathing. Third priority to this is the use of caffeine however it's generally not worth the risk as it interferes with the ability to use the first two means.

The mental energy associated with constructing is chaotic and it's important to consider one's ability to pivot.

The goal of The Construct is to train oneself to become resilient and focused under such pressures by relying on the mechanics of the mind alone.
