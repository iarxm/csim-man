Necessary Preperation

TL;DR

The running principles aim to emulate as specifically as possible the rulebooks of the ISA(Internation Surf Assocation) and the WSL.

Principles from those rulebooks are assumed true, unless otherwise stated within the simulation rulebook. The ISA rulebook will take precedent over the WSL equivalent when there are conflicting principles.

Each athlete is expected to read the entire document and fully understand the purpose of the training, the format, the scheduling and the rules.

Understand how to navigate the document to find all relevant information such as 'Athletes Code of Conduct', the schedule and draw, and the scores of each heat. Have immediate access to the link to the document, and have the google sheets app downloaded.

Each athlete is expected to undertake each next step with speed, maintain alertness, understand when their next heat is, and keep in mind that they are taking the role of an athlete and thus are adopting the associate values of being an athlete

Each athlete must return the jersey to the beach marshal bucket immediately after each heat. They must collect their next jersey as quickly as possible, and choose a different colour to the previous heat.


ATHLETE PREPERATION

Prepare a kit bag with all necessary equipment for training
- Watch
- Learner's notebook; Wave observation notebook/cards/board
- Water
- Backups of board, wax, fins, fin key, leash
- Waterproof and warm clothes for staying warm during gaps

Immediate access to the simulator document with an understanding of its layout and how to navigate it.

Full understanding of everything set out in the document and rulebook.

Consider arriving before checkin to be fully prepared and to do a thorough and individualized warmup surf.
Setup base with ease of access to equipment



SCOPE OF SIM

The goal of contest simulation is to create high density exposure to the reality of a contest environment. And to do so for all skill levels, ranging from initial club entry, to National, to ISA Games and to WSL Tours.
This creates the environment necessary for each individual athlete to benchmark their actual vs imagined progression, and to train the specific skills they lack.


!! This is objective testing and skill training, and not a means to perform for showcasing and gaining status, or to beat specific athletes. If that is your intention then you are in the wrong place

!! For athletes of less skill and experience, it's suggested to generate the motivation to incrementally improve scores by half decimal places over a long period of time. 
!! And simultaneously to become familiar with the stress and consequence of a contest, and to concurrently develop the skills to find a series of quality waves within a time constraint of 20 minutes.

!! It's also an opportunity to practise alignment with Olympic values, through content such as the ISA code of conduct. This is a more important skill in relation to long term success.


## Standard Principles

SIMULATION PROTOCOLS

"Check in at the beginning of the event
"
Ask all necessary questions to ensure you have an adequate understanding of the plan.

Once the event starts, you are expected to be alert and on immediate standby unless otherwise communicated
The plan may change rapidly in adaption to the dynamics of a surf break

As the session unfolds, you are expected to be within close enough proximity to be informed by such changes
There are situations where you will be given time to rest and hang out without concern. But only when specifically stated and when not in contradiction to other information


HEAT PROTOCOLS

Check in before each heat at beach marshal station
Change rash vest for each heat. Provide color to marshal/judges

Green board will indicate the beginning of a heat
Yellow board will indicate that 5 minutes remain

Unless otherwise stated, heats will be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes of paddle out. There will be a small delay between heats

Stay clear of the competitors lineup during paddle out.
Prone to shore immediately at finish.
Return to beach marshall ASAP and return the jersey
If your heat is next, checkin and state your new jersey colour

!! There may be consequences for breaking certain principles depending on how much disruption it causes. This will come in the form of penalties affecting point allocation.
If you are carelessly slow in returning to shore or on returning to the beach marshal, you will likely be late for your next paddle out. The schedule will not change


JUDGING BOOTH PROXIMITY

Results, scores and evoling draws can be read from the draw spreadsheet
The scoring will be digitalized in which case you can use your phone to obtain the results and schedule


!! Be particularly respectful when in close proximity to the judges
It takes significant attention to maintain quality judging. The management of distractions is essential. Your care towards this principle will ensure your own scoring will be accurate.

Before asking questions, first check if any competitors are up and riding and wait until the wave has been scored

Avoid asking questions about time. Instead, keep track of the green board after your heat.
There will usually be a minute or two between heats. If you have just surfed, note the time when the next heat starts, or start a new stopwatch.
You don't need to be precise with this time keeping. Remember the goal in this regard is usually to be by the waters edge for the beginning of your paddle out.
If possible, a timer will be displayed by the color board which can be checked by those around the judging station.

Athletes are welcome to assist in spotting and judging
If you see someone paddling call out their color
Watch to remember the details of what they do on the wave. The judges may ask for recalls of details missed or else forgotten. This is particularly important during back to back waves and spit peaks.

Note the order of waves ridden in close succession.




JUDGING PRINCIPLES

JUDGING CRITERIA

Major maneuvers are the backbone of increasing your scores. One single maneuvre brings a score into the excellent range.



SCORING PARITY FACTORS

Scoring parity is an evolving concept and will be refined objectively as time evolves.

Depeding on the event, a scoring parity will be applied in a degree which correlates to the division and the surfers
In the second division, the higher seeded athletes will be disadvantaged through higher parities so to be at an overall disadvantage


In division one, it will be scaled to make it feel as though higher skilled athletes are competing against athletes of equivalent skill
The higher skilled athletes will still hold the advantage but only by a small margin
The best possible surfing of the least skilled surfer, relative to their most common performance norm, would scale to about 6 to 7 points
This itself would be relative to a scale where the higher skilled surfer can normally score about 5 to 6 points.
Therefore, if the lower skilled athlete performs excellently they will just beat the average performance of the higher skilled surfer

This is not reason to become frustrated or undermine the status of higher scores of a less skilled athlete
Remember that the highest skilled athletes in these events are already receiving inflated scores relative to WSL scales

It's in your interest, as a higher skilled athlete, to lose during these events when performing at your normal level of performance
It's in your interest, as a lower skilled athlete, to win during these events when performing significantly above average

There will be errors made in implementing this until it's worked out more precisely




PROTEST

You're encouraged to protest your scores when you reason an error is significant
In some cases, a major error can be reversed if the reversal is practical. But in general the result is final.

Protesting achieves the following
A. Improves judging and event management
B. Improves dialogue with judges over errors made, and thus improves capacities in protesting results at real events
C. Improves your understanding of the judging criteria and priority

The organizers and judges will make mistakes. And they will also respond to protests with mistakes.
Be understanding and patient with this
If you feel like a judgement or protest was unfairly dealt with, try again.
Consider this as part of the contest simulation, and so, learn how to do so in a way where your surfing will not suffer from the possible psychological consequences of recieving an unwanted decision. Develop resilience.

If an athlete protests, then the schedule may be suspended to resolve the judgement before proceeding with subsequent heats






## DRAW FORMATS

DRAWS

EXAMPLES OF SYNTAX DESCRIPTIONS

RND1 1	ROUND 1 HEAT 1
RND2	SHORTHAND FOR ALL HEATS OF ROUND 2
BON1 1	BONUS 1 HEAT 1
FIN1 1	FINAL OF DIVISION 1 - HEAT 1; Typically just 1 heat although sometimes a multi heat final with eg best of 3 can be run
FIN1    SHORTHAND FOR FIN1 1



Double elim with bonus and multi divisions:
Repacharge system with multiple finals to establish all specific placings after those in the main round final. And with Bonus heats to both generate motivation to earn more points and catch up with main round finalists, and to equalize heat count opportunities.
The higher level seeds can choose to bypass bonus heats so to both simulate wait times found in real contests and to prepare for their main round final. They will however be forfeiting their opportunity to extend their overall point lead.

Best of three heats progresses from round 1. 

If draw for 2nd place, it will be decided on:
- The result of the heat between the surfers who drew
Bottom three will go to division 2 final. 
Tournament 2 will be a second cycle with bonus points awarded


POINTS ALLOCATION

POINTS
1	10,000
2	7,800
3	
4	4,745
5	3320
6	3000
7	2600
8	2200
9	1800
10	1330

Bonus heats may carry an allocation of extra points to the athletes in their respective categories if they manage to out compete athletes of a higher seeding.
If an eliminated surfer places higher than the highest performing surfer, they may earn an extra 2000 points.
If they perform better than the highest placing athlete in the division 2 final, they may recieve enough points to equalize their overall placing on the points leaderboard with that athlete

Depending on the number of competitors per tournament cycle in the event, FINAL2 placing will determine overall placings below those who have progressed to the main FINAL1

Bonus Heats will reward extra points to an athletes overal stack of event points.

A competitor who places 2nd in FINAL2 but who places higher than 1st of FINAL2 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with that competitor in that cycle

A competitor who places 1st in FINAL2 but who places higher than an athlete from FINAL1 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with last place of FINAL1

The general rule is that a skillful result within a BONUS heat presents the opportunity to equalize with an athlete who finishes 1 place ahead in the tournament cycle. 4th place would recieve equal points to 3rd; 5th to 4th and so on.




## OLYMPIAN PRINCIPLES

OLYMPIC CODE OF CONDUCT

The ISA Code of Conduct outlines the standard of behavior expected of all members of Federations that are members of the International Surfing Association (ISA), as well as all Officials employed or volunteering with the ISA.  It is a formal statement of the values and ethical standards that guide individuals in sport. It is a set of principles and norms to which sportspeople and officials can be held accountable when representing their country or officiating at any ISA event.  The Code is used as a point of reference when dealing with disciplinary procedures against members or officials.

An athlete who competes is committed to the following:

Respect the rules and play in the spirit of the game.
Display high standards of behavior that promote a positive image for surfing.
Respect my opponents.
Respect other athletes and officials’ cultures and beliefs.
Respect the officials and their decisions.
Be gracious in victory and defeat.
Give my teammates positive input and feedback.
Compete fairly.
Refrain from the use of profane, insulting, harassing or otherwise offensive language or behaviour on or off the field of play.
Strive to maintain a sense of self-control and dignity at all times.
Thank officials and opposing teams.
Maintain a sense of integrity.
Respect the facilities and equipment.
Do my best to try to be a true team player.
Help others to resist corrupting pressures.
Denounce those who attempt to discredit the sport.
Honor those who defend the sport’s good reputation.
Reject corruption, drug abuse, racism & violence.

Never advocate or condone the abuse of drugs or other banned substances or methods.
Abstain from the use of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages when representing my country or at an ISA event.
Never provide under age participants with alcohol.
Participate in all team testing and satisfy all team program-testing objectives.

Not block the ISA logo during video or still camera photography activity.
Provide interviews to official and on-site event media as requested regardless of heat result.

Communicate and co-operate with registered medical practitioners/testing centers in the diagnoses, treatment and management of medical problems and respect the concerns these medical people have when they are considering my future health and well being and when they are making decisions regarding my ability to continue to play or train.


TRAINING PRINCIPLES

(TODO)


TODO - ORGANISATION

Goals and logic of each format
Protest protocol improvements
Clarify formats via detailed descriptions
Precision in jersey usage
More breaks for improving judging focus and simulating real contest gaps
Experiment with shorter sessions. And with multiday simulation
Keep to specific times for gaps between heats
6 heats either over 1 or 2 days
or 9 over 3



Increase stock of jerseys
Yellow for winner
Yellow for prize of whole series?
Small prizes per simulation?
Team based approach



NOTES TO MENTION IN DEBRIEF/CHECKIN

Start with reading the olympic values
Judging Criteria - Major Maneuver
Bonus Heat - 
Phone to check scores
Schedulin Q - dual heats or 1 at a time?
Covering other business on rules?


CONTEST SIMULATOR PLANNING

Download offline contingency documents for situations where the location may be out of range of mobile internet
For each location, optimize for weather sheltering that enables high quality judging
Keep seeding codes formal and consistent
Vertical layouts enables simple navigation and natural understanding
And relational data structures can naturally develop
Ensure a simple spreadsheet is ready for deployment in the case of technical issues with the main document


DEV TODO
TODO - set initial seed code to R# for 'Rank' X - make a glob to retrive number and discard letter




How does this document work?
The data workflow of a contest is surprisingly simple
The leaderboard sheet contains seeding which inputs into the round 1 draw
the draw feeds into the meta data of the judging scorecards per judges sheet
The scores across the judges sheets are fed into tally sheet for averaging
The averages are fed into the results sheet
The results sheet feeds back into the draw sheet to calculate the next progression
The draw and the results are filtered into the live sheet for a more compact and readable format. Also providing quick access to any active heats



Opponent simulation via random number generator
Simulate specific surfers like a chess engine
Draw up alts per draw format for addition or subtraction of athlete numbers



Github pages version of the manual
Sidebar injection of the html code

Stabilize v4 with the circular and visual-data mixed logic
Deploy v4 and integrate feedback of use into development of v5
v5 will be with a database sheet as the master source of all data
input views will create datapipelines into it
reading views will pull data out of it
one source of data facts
necessary for more complicated concepts to be implemented such as algorithmic score parity and athlete simulation
