(DRAFT V4)

## Necessary Preparation

### Briefing

The running principles aim to emulate as specifically as possible the rulebooks of both the International Surf Association and the World Surf League.

Principles from those rulebooks are assumed, unless otherwise stated within this manual. When there are conflicting principles, this manual and associated draw spreadsheet will take first precedent. Then the ISA rulebook will take precedent over the WSL rulebook.

Each athlete is expected to read this manual to understand the purpose and mechanics of this type of training. This implies achieving an understanding of the draw format, the scheduling and the principles of how to train.

It's essential to be able to navigate this document so as to be able to find all relevant information, such as the 'Athletes Code of Conduct'. This is also the case for the contest simulator spreadsheet, so to be able to locate the schedule, the draw, and the scores of each heat. Ensure immediate access to the link to the spreadsheet, and ensure the google sheets app is downloaded onto smartphone.

The following is expected of each athlete.

- Undertake each next step with speed.
- Maintain alertness.
- Understand the sequence of heats and their expected times.
- Comprehend that taking on the identity of an athlete is to commit oneself to the ideal values of an athlete.
- Return the jersey to the beach marshal bucket immediately after each heat. Collect the next jersey as quickly as is possible, choosing a different colour to the previous heat.


### Athlete Preparation

Prepare a kit bag with all necessary equipment for training.

- Watch
- Learner's notebook; Wave observation notebook/cards/board
- Water
- Backups of board, wax, fins, fin key, leash
- Waterproof and warm clothes for staying warm during gaps

Immediate access to the simulator spreadsheet with an understanding of its layout and how to navigate it.

Full understanding of everything set out in the spreadsheet and manual.

Consider arriving before check-in so to be fully prepared and to provide ample opportunity for a thorough and individualized beach and surf warm-up.

Setup a personal stations with ease of access to equipment in relation to the simulator site.


### Purpose of Simulation

The problem is that training with an intention alone works out to be insufficient training. A more optimal method of training for a particular athletic goal is to perform regularly in a situation that equivalently emulates the situation under which the goal will be achieved. Rarely will it be argued that casual training ever feels like the high pressure situation of performing in a real contest. To confront face on that which is stressful is a good way to grow into it and become resilient and adaptable under the pressure of that situation. It's an illusion to believe that training the purely technical skills of a sport will in itself provide the basis to succeed in any particular contest. It is perhaps equivalent to thinking that training to swim in a pool would perfectly prepare an athlete to swim in a stormy ocean.

How common is it to find oneself surfing aimlessly and without an accurate sense to the quality of training and strategy within a short period of a heat? How difficult is it in an actual heat with tough opponents of a similar skill level? What type of thoughts and emotions actually rush through one's mind? What mistakes are made? Consider how valuable it may be to confront these questions on a weekly basis and to begin to solve them earlier rather than later.

The goal of the contest simulation is to create high density exposure to the reality of a contest environment so to create the basis for the necessary adaption. And to do so for all skill levels, ranging from initial club entry up to both ISA Games and WSL Series Events.

This also creates the environment necessary for each individual athlete to benchmark their actual vs imagined progression, and to train the specific skills they lack.

!! Note - even though this is a means of learning to find ease, solve problems and perform under contest pressure, it's not a place to express one's desire to perform so to gain status and feel elated about positive performances. If that is your intention then you are in the wrong place. The intention here is to develop a general attitude of level headedness, joyful effort and graciousness, both in light of wins or losses. Again, it's significant amounts of experience that lends to this outcome.

!! For athletes of less experience and skill, it's suggested to generate the motivation to incrementally improve scores by half decimal places over a longer period of time. And to not predominantly focus on the competitive aspect of the training. Heats can be used as a means to train a technical skill under pressure. Similarly for the highest skilled athletes, the mere attendance in a contest environment over dense regular intervals can unconsciously create the desired adaption.

!! And simultaneously to become familiar with the stress and consequence of competition, and to develop the skills to find a series of quality waves within a constraint of time and pressure.

!! It's also an opportunity to practise alignment with Olympic values, through content such as the ISA code of conduct. This is a more important skill in relation to long term success.



## Standard Principles

### Simulation Event Protocols

"Check in at the beginning of the event
"
Ask all necessary questions to ensure you have an adequate understanding of the plan.

Once the event starts, you are expected to be alert and on immediate standby unless otherwise communicated
The plan may change rapidly in adaption to the dynamics of a surf break

As the session unfolds, you are expected to be within close enough proximity to be informed by such changes
There are situations where you will be given time to rest and hang out without concern. But only when specifically stated and when not in contradiction to other information


### Heat Protocols

Check in before each heat at beach marshal station
Change rash vest for each heat. Provide color to marshal/judges

Green board will indicate the beginning of a heat
Yellow board will indicate that 5 minutes remain

Unless otherwise stated, heats will be 20 minutes long with 5 minutes of paddle out. There will be a small delay between heats

Stay clear of the competitors lineup during paddle out.
Prone to shore immediately at finish.
Return to beach marshal ASAP and return the jersey
If your heat is next, check-in and state your new jersey colour

!! There may be consequences for breaking certain principles depending on how much disruption it causes. This will come in the form of penalties affecting point allocation.
If you are carelessly slow in returning to shore or on returning to the beach marshal, you will likely be late for your next paddle out. The schedule will not change


### Proximity to Judging Booth

Results, scores and evolving draws can be read from the draw spreadsheet
The scoring will be digitalized in which case you can use your phone to obtain the results and schedule


!! Be particularly respectful when in close proximity to the judges
It takes significant attention to maintain quality judging. The management of distractions is essential. Your care towards this principle will ensure your own scoring will be accurate.

Before asking questions, first check if any competitors are up and riding and wait until the wave has been scored

Avoid asking questions about time. Instead, keep track of the green board after your heat.
There will usually be a minute or two between heats. If you have just surfed, note the time when the next heat starts, or start a new stopwatch.
You don't need to be precise with this time keeping. Remember the goal in this regard is usually to be by the waters edge for the beginning of your paddle out.
If possible, a timer will be displayed by the color board which can be checked by those around the judging station.

Athletes are welcome to assist in spotting and judging
If you see someone paddling call out their color
Watch to remember the details of what they do on the wave. The judges may ask for recalls of details missed or else forgotten. This is particularly important during back to back waves and spit peaks.

Note the order of waves ridden in close succession.




## Judging Principles

### Judging Criteria

Major maneuvers are the backbone of increasing your scores. One single maneuver brings a score into the excellent range.


### Scoring Parity

Scoring parity is an evolving concept and will be refined objectively as time evolves.

Depending on the event, a scoring parity will be applied in a degree which correlates to the division and the surfers
In the second division, the higher seeded athletes will be disadvantaged through higher parities so to be at an overall disadvantage


In division one, it will be scaled to make it feel as though higher skilled athletes are competing against athletes of equivalent skill
The higher skilled athletes will still hold the advantage but only by a small margin
The best possible surfing of the least skilled surfer, relative to their most common performance norm, would scale to about 6 to 7 points
This itself would be relative to a scale where the higher skilled surfer can normally score about 5 to 6 points.
Therefore, if the lower skilled athlete performs excellently they will just beat the average performance of the higher skilled surfer

This is not reason to become frustrated or undermine the status of higher scores of a less skilled athlete
Remember that the highest skilled athletes in these events are already receiving inflated scores relative to WSL scales

It's in your interest, as a higher skilled athlete, to lose during these events when performing at your normal level of performance
It's in your interest, as a lower skilled athlete, to win during these events when performing significantly above average

There will be errors made in implementing this until it's worked out more precisely


### Protest

You're encouraged to protest your scores when you reason an error is significant
In some cases, a major error can be reversed if the reversal is practical. But in general the result is final.

Protesting achieves the following
A. Improves judging and event management
B. Improves dialogue with judges over errors made, and thus improves capacities in protesting results at real events
C. Improves your understanding of the judging criteria and priority

The organizers and judges will make mistakes. And they will also respond to protests with mistakes.
Be understanding and patient with this
If you feel like a judgement or protest was unfairly dealt with, try again.
Consider this as part of the contest simulation, and so, learn how to do so in a way where your surfing will not suffer from the possible psychological consequences of recieving an unwanted decision. Develop resilience.

If an athlete protests, then the schedule may be suspended to resolve the judgement before proceeding with subsequent heats


## Simulation Formats

### Draws

Examples of shorthand notations that may be found in the simulator app.

| Notation | Description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| RND1 1   | ROUND 1 HEAT 1                     |
| RND2     | SHORTHAND FOR ALL HEATS OF ROUND 2 |
| BON1 1   | BONUS 1 HEAT 1                     |
| FIN1 1   | FINAL OF DIVISION 1, HEAT 1        | Typically just 1 heat although sometimes a multi heat final with eg best of 3 can be run |
| FIN1     | SHORTHAND FOR FIN1 1               |

Double elim with bonus and multi divisions:
Repacharge system with multiple finals to establish all specific placings after those in the main round final. And with Bonus heats to both generate motivation to earn more points and catch up with main round finalists, and to equalize heat count opportunities.
The higher level seeds can choose to bypass bonus heats so to both simulate wait times found in real contests and to prepare for their main round final. They will however be forfeiting their opportunity to extend their overall point lead.

Best of three heats progresses from round 1. 

If draw for 2nd place, it will be decided on:
- The result of the heat between the surfers who drew
Bottom three will go to division 2 final. 
Tournament 2 will be a second cycle with bonus points awarded


### POINTS ALLOCATION


| PLACE | POINTS |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 10,000 |
| 2     | 7,800  |
| 3     | 6,085  |
| 4     | 4,745  |
| 5     | 3,320  |
| 6     | 3,000  |
| 7     | 2,600  |
| 8     | 2,200  |
| 9     | 1,800  |
| 10    | 1,330  |

Bonus heats may carry an allocation of extra points to the athletes in their respective categories if they manage to out compete athletes of a higher seeding.
If an eliminated surfer places higher than the highest performing surfer, they may earn an extra 2000 points.
If they perform better than the highest placing athlete in the division 2 final, they may receive enough points to equalize their overall placing on the points leader board with that athlete

Depending on the number of competitors per tournament cycle in the event, FINAL2 placing will determine overall placings below those who have progressed to the main FINAL1

Bonus Heats will reward extra points to an athletes overall stack of event points.

A competitor who places 2nd in FINAL2 but who places higher than 1st of FINAL2 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with that competitor in that cycle

A competitor who places 1st in FINAL2 but who places higher than an athlete from FINAL1 in BONUS1 can equalize their points with last place of FINAL1

The general rule is that a skillful result within a BONUS heat presents the opportunity to equalize with an athlete who finishes 1 place ahead in the tournament cycle. 4th place would recieve equal points to 3rd; 5th to 4th and so on.


## Olympic Principles

### Olympic Code of Conduct

This section is adapted from the International Surfing Association.

The ISA Code of Conduct outlines the standard of behavior expected of all members of Federations that are members of the International Surfing Association (ISA), as well as all Officials employed or volunteering with the ISA.  It is a formal statement of the values and ethical standards that guide individuals in sport. It is a set of principles and norms to which sportspeople and officials can be held accountable when representing their country or officiating at any ISA event.  The Code is used as a point of reference when dealing with disciplinary procedures against members or officials.

An athlete who competes is committed to the following:

- Respect the rules and play in the spirit of the game.
- Display high standards of behavior that promote a positive image for surfing.
- Respect opponents.
- Respect other athletes and officials’ cultures and beliefs.
- Respect the officials and their decisions.
- Be gracious in victory and defeat.
- Give teammates positive input and feedback.
- Compete fairly.
- Refrain from the use of profane, insulting, harassing or otherwise offensive language or behaviour on or off the field of play.
- Strive to maintain a sense of self-control and dignity at all times.
- Thank officials and opposing teams.
- Maintain a sense of integrity.
- Respect the facilities and equipment.
- Do one's best to be a true team player.
- Help others to resist corrupting pressures.
- Denounce those who attempt to discredit the sport.
- Honor those who defend the sport’s good reputation.
- Reject corruption, drug abuse, racism & violence.


- Never advocate or condone the abuse of drugs or other banned substances or methods.
- Abstain from the use of tobacco products and alcoholic beverages when representing my country or at an ISA event.
- Never provide under age participants with alcohol.
- Participate in all team testing and satisfy all team program-testing objectives.

- Not block the ISA logo during video or still camera photography activity.
- Provide interviews to official and on-site event media as requested regardless of heat result.

- Communicate and co-operate with registered medical practitioners/testing centers in the diagnoses, treatment and management of medical problems and respect the concerns these medical people have when they are considering my future health and well being and when they are making decisions regarding my ability to continue to play or train.
